## Briefly About Me:
Not so long ago I got carried away with front-end development and began to study Html, Css on my own. It was difficult at first, but the more I learned, the easier it was to understand new information.\
\
There are no restrictions on development in the Front-end, here you need to constantly learn and improve yourself. Front-end in web development is very versatile and rich in different technologies for completely different tasks. This is the main reason I decided to learn Web Development.\
\
A technical education gives me the ability to think mathematically and systematically. I highly appreciate teamwork and the ability to do a common cause. I am sociable and polite. Tolerant of criticism.\
\
My goal is to achieve the highest possible skill in this area. And I believe, that I can achieve this.
